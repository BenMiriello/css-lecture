# HELP. TROUBLE.
 
Here's the page you know well already. However, it looks horrible. Here are all the things that are wrong with this page. Locate as many bugs as you can and crush them!
Pssst. don't pattern-match from the previous page. We changed the classes and logic. Read the bug, look at the page, try to figure out what's wrong. 
1. It seems the CSS file does not load anymore?! Fix that first.
2. Background:
    - the background color doesn not register;
    - the green box should not be there at all;
3. The red square on the right-ish side should be:
    - a circle;
    - located on the left;
    - located under the content;
    - have some nice gradient background;
    - scroll with the page
4. The questions should be centered!
5. Answers:
    - why are the boxes so oddly shaped?!
    - should have animation but it doesn't seem to work,
    - when you hover over an answer, its color should indicate whether it's right or wrong - it doesn't seem to be a case;
    - text should be centered;
6. Explanations:
    - should not have a space underneath;
    - it should fit in the box;
    - it should not have this much space on the right;
7. "Hello friends" does not seem to have the right look...
8. When you hover over a link, it should have a distinct background color;
