        <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> Aha, Cascading Style Sheets. A cascade is an algorithm that defines how to combine values originating from different sources. Style sheets are basically a cascade -- child elements inherit values from the parent elements (except for e.g. @keyframes). <span class="lol">Good luck debugging!</span>

      </div>
      <div class="explanation" tabindex="0"> 
        <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout - it is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. Such a box consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. Remember that padding and margins are transparent! So, if you need more space around the element - it's margins; if between the border and the content - it's padding.

      <div class="explanation" tabindex="0"> 
        <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> Flexbox and Grid are two different ways to organize your page design so it's not all over the place.Grid layout divides space into columns & rows. Like table layouts, but better! Any given element may take just one field, an entire row or an entire row and a bit of a column. Flexbox layout distributes space along a single column or row. Like float layouts, but better!

      <div class="explanation" tabindex="0"> 
        <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. Great news: you can chain them to reach a very specific element! You can e.g. choose to target only the div of a specific class, id and that belongs to a given parent element. Please have a look at an article in the readme about these selectors.

      <div class="explanation" tabindex="0"> 
        <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> There are three ways to connect CSS to your project. Inline CSS - or, the style specified in tags - is a good solution for one and only element of a given style. CSS included internally (below head tag in the html file) will only refer to this specific html file and so may be good for small apps. Inline styling (in the tags) will make debugging your app difficult. External CSS file (link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "mystyle.css") feels best organized.

      <div class="explanation" tabindex="0"> 
        <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> That's it. If you want one element on top of another, look into z-index. If you want the element to be always on top, choose a high integer instead of 1.

        <div class="answer z"><span class="a">op-index: 100%;</span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation" tabindex="0"> 
        <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> Remember that "opacity:1.0;" means "not transparent" and anything below 1.0 increases element's transparency. If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, in this example, use RGBA - it sets the color and opacity for the background color and not the text or other elements within a container. This would be the syntax for the kinda greenish almost transparent background: "background: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.3)".

      </div>
      <div class="explanation" tabindex="0"> 
        <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> Each of the html elements comes with default properties, display being one of them. For instance, the p tag, usually takes a whole width and a generous margin because it comes with the block display property. Then, the span tag always stays in line with other items because of the inline display property. However, there's a middle ground: if you want your p tag to stay in line but also have the possibility to change its width and height, go ahead, overwrite the display to be the inline-block!

Use the :focus selector and add border that will make it easy to follow. By the way, in order for an element to be focusable, you need to include tabindex="0" in an html tag ("0" means "stadard flow", "-1" meaning "don't focus", and "1" means "focus first").

        <div class="explanation" tabindex="0"> 
          <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> What you want to google in such a case are <strong>chained css selectors.</strong> For instance, "div:hover + div" translates into "when I hover over a div element with a class of important, change the styling of its next div sibling". Now, if you would like all the next siblings to be affected, you'd change the + sign into ~. See here:

            <span class="exp">EXPLANATION:</span> The border-width property can have from one to four values (going clockwise: for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border). Same for the border-color. For instance, the border in this question is "border-color: blue green red yellow;" and "border-width: 30px 10px 4px 20px;". It also has "border-radius:15%;", which is why it's kinda round. If you increase radius to 100%, you'll have a circle.
